            Top Convos needs some special permissions from your browser to be able to collect data from facebook.com.
            If any malicious program in your system infects the addon and abuse those permissions the developer won't
            be responsible. To protect this addon make sure your system is malware free and all security features in
            your browser are enabled.
        </li>
        <li>
            You cannot use, copy, redistribute, sell, modify any resources or source codes of Top Convos.</li>
        <li>
            All rights reserved to the developer (Rafsun Masud).
        </li>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Top Convos collects data about all Facebook conversations and participants. Participants are users
            involved in a conversation. Data that are
            collected are- number of total messages in conversatoins, and participants' full name, Facebook ID and link
            to the profile picture. No message from any conversation is collected.
        </li>

        <li>
            Collected data are stored in the memory temporarily. They aren't stored in the local storage. They aren't
            sent to the developer. Once the browser or the Top Convos tab is closed all collected data are deleted.
        </li>

        <li>
            When user explicitly wants to share "Top Three Friends" on Facebook through a share dialog, Top Convos
            uploads a image to Cloudinary. The uploaded image is displayed on user's Facebook timeline and contains
            name, profile picture and number of total messages of top three people in the conversation list. Only
            developer has access to the images on Cloudinary.
        </li>

        <li>
            Some data are also recorded temporarily in the memory containing debug information. They do not contain any
            personal information. User can download those data as log file and send to the developer to help debugging.
        </li>

        <li>
            To link users to developer's Facebook page, an iframe is added which contains Facebook like button.
            Facebook may track user through the iframe.
        </li>

        <li>
            Although permission for Dropbox and Cloudinary is asked, no data from those websites are accessed. Those
            permissions are used to load developer's news (from Dropbox) and upload image (on Cloudinary, mentioned
            above).
